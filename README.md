# MeowwwOS

MeowwwOS is my test of an x86 OS coded in **ASM and mostly C** :D  


## Why did I make this shi?  
Well… it helps me learn coding and OS development.  
It’s a great experiment and I’m in love with tech.  


## Why use it?  
For fun, mostly in an emulator.  
Wanna run it on your real PC? Not recommended… at least yet.  
You get **cats and freedom** :3  


## I have a problem  
It’s your problem, not mine… just kidding.  
Send an issue and I’ll try to fix it, but my brain’s got 4KB RAM so don’t expect miracles XD  


## Bradar I have Linux/Windows, why would I need this?  
…phack you bradar, next comment  


## I love it  
I love you


## Are you mental?  
Yes.
